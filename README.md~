# Introduction to Android Wear - Courseware

## Who

David Cuartielles and Andreas Goransson work at different companies at the Malmo Incubator (MINC) and have written the book Professional Android Wearables for Wiley's Wrox series.

## What - Simple Introduction

Are you interested in programming for Android Wear devices? We are! We've been into designing wearable technologies using Android for a couple of years now, and with the arrival of Android Wear APIs, it has become easier than ever to create your own Android centric experiences to wear around your wrist.

If you want to learn about Android Wear from zero, or if you want to share your experience in programming for this exciting platform, come and join us in a weekly tour to the basics of Wear. This is our suggested agenda, but it is open for discussion. We want to find like-minded people willing to get as much as possible from Wear.
We will meet at MINC's open office space on Tuesdays after work during the month of April and the first week of May. Join us!

## Agenda

We will make 1h introductory sessions to different aspects of Android Wear. The sessions will happen on a weekly basis between March and May 2015.

## This is Lovely!! I want to support you

We have written this book about the topic: Professional Android Wearables. But you don't need to purchase it attend or to follow the sessions. We believe that sharing is caring, we just want to share with you what we know. 

However, we take donations on our Eventbrite page. The money will be spent in buying cakes for the workshops as MINC is kindly donating the space, coffee, tea and even popcorn for FREE.
